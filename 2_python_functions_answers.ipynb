    "You are tasked with creating a simple calculator in Python that can perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. The goal is to create a series of functions for each operation and then implement a main function that takes the user's operation choice into account.\n",

    "#### Operation Functions:\n",
    "**addition(a, b):** This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.  \n",
    "**subtraction(a, b):** This function takes two numbers as input and returns their difference (a - b).  \n",

    "**division(a, b):** This function takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the division (a / b). Ensure you handle the case where b is equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Function:\n",
    "**calculator():** This function is the main function of the calculator. It should prompt the user to choose an operation among addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Then, it should ask the user to input two numbers, call the appropriate function based on the user's choice, and display the result.\n",
